  Abstract                 = {An investigation was undertaken into the effectiveness of a range of hyperspectral approaches for estimating the concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and the carotenoids at the plant canopy and leaf scales. Measurements of spectral reflectance, biophysical characteristics and pigment composition were made for a bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) canopy, and its components, throughout a growing season. The results indicate that narrow-band reflectance indices, such as the pigment-specific simple ratio (PSSR), can be developed which have extremely strong relationships with the concentration per unit area of individual pigments at the canopy scale. Spectral derivative approaches, particularly those based on pseudo absorbance (Log 1/R), are also closely related to canopy pigment concentration per unit area, but are more useful for deriving estimates of the concentration per unit mass of photosynthetic pigments at both canopy and leaf scales.},

  Abstract                 = {An algorithm utilizing reflectance spectra bands in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) region of the solar spectrum was developed for the remote estimation of the concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids in soybeans. The defining of specific bands in the reflectance spectrum that corresponded to absorption bands of the individual pigments was basic to the development of the algorithm. The detection of these bands was rendered difficult by the lack of detail in reflectance spectra. It was therefore necessary to manipulate the reflectance spectra so that absorption bands due to specific pigments could be detected and their spectral maxima defined. It was found that by dividing soybean reflectance spectra by an arbitrarily selected reference soybean reflectance spectrum, ratio spectra were obtained in which the absorption bands could be distinctly seen and their wavelength defined. These ratio spectra allowed the defining of those bands corresponding to the absorption bands of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids. The strong linear relationships of certain combinations of the bands in the ratio spectra to the concentrations of the photosynthetic pigments made it possible to develop a ratio analysis of reflectance spectra algorithm (RARS) by which the concentrations of these pigments could be calculated from the reflectance spectra. The measurements necessary for the development of RARS were made using soybeans which were grown at different nitrogen levels in order to obtain a range of reflectance spectra. A test of the RARS algorithm using other soybean plants showed very good agreement between measured pigment values and those calculated using RARS.},

  Abstract                 = {The position of the inflexion point in the red edge region (680 to 780 nm) of the spectral reflectance signature, termed the red edge position (REP), is affected by biochemical and biophysical parameters and has been used as a means to estimate foliar chlorophyll or nitrogen content. In this paper, we report on a new technique for extracting the REP from hyperspectral data that aims to mitigate the discontinuity in the relationship between the REP and the nitrogen content caused by the existence of a double-peak feature on the derivative spectrum. It is based on a linear extrapolation of straight lines on the far-red (680 to 700 nm) and NIR (725 to 760 nm) flanks of the first derivative reflectance spectrum. The REP is then defined by the wavelength value at the intersection of the two lines. The output is a REP equation, REP&#xa0;=&#xa0;âˆ’&#xa0;(c1&#xa0;âˆ’&#xa0;c2)&#xa0;/&#xa0;(m1&#xa0;âˆ’&#xa0;m2), where c1 and c2, and m1 and m2 represent the intercepts and slopes of the far-red and NIR lines, respectively. Far-red wavebands at 679.65 and 694.30 nm in combination with NIR wavebands at 732.46 and 760.41 nm or at 723.64 and 760.41 nm were identified as the optimal combinations for calculating nitrogen-sensitive REPs for three spectral data sets (rye canopy, and maize leaf and mixed grass/herb leaf stack spectra). REPs extracted using this new technique (linear extrapolation method) showed high correlations with a wide range of foliar nitrogen concentrations for both narrow and wider bandwidth spectra, being comparable with results obtained using the traditional linear interpolation, polynomial and inverted Gaussian fitting techniques. In addition, the new technique is simple as is the case with the linear interpolation method, but performed better than the latter method in the case of maize leaves at different developmental stages and mixed grass/herb leaves with a low nitrogen concentration.},

  Abstract                 = {The long wavelength edge of the major chlorophyll absorption feature in the spectrum of a vegetation canopy moves to longer wavelengths with an increase in chlorophyll content. The position of this red-edge has been used successfully to estimate, by remote sensing, the chlorophyll content of vegetation canopies. Techniques used to estimate this red-edge position (REP) have been designed for use on small volumes of continuous spectral data rather than the large volumes of discontinuous spectral data recorded by contemporary satellite spectrometers. Also, each technique produces a different value of REP from the same spectral data and REP values are relatively insensitive to chlorophyll content at high values of chlorophyll content. This paper reports on the <I>design</I> and <I>indirect evaluation</I> of a surrogate REP index for use with spectral data recorded at the standard band settings of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). This index, termed the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI), was evaluated using model spectra, field spectra and MERIS data. It was easy to calculate (and so can be automated), was correlated strongly with REP but unlike REP was sensitive to high values of chlorophyll content. As a result this index became an official MERIS level-2 product of the European Space Agency in March 2004. Further direct evaluation of the MTCI is proposed, using both greenhouse and field data.},

From these reflectance spectra, narrow-band and broad-band (AVHRR, TM, MSS) red and near-infrared (NIR) vegetation index values were calculated. The performance of the vegetation indices was evaluated based on their capability to accurately estimate leaf area index (LAI) and percent green cover. Background effects were found for each of the tested vegetation indices. However the background effects are most pronounced in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI). Background effects can be reduced using either the perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) or soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) formulations. The narrow-band versions of these vegetation indices had only slightly better accuracy than their broad-band counterparts. The background effects were minimized using derivative based vegetation indices, which measure the amplitude of the chlorophyll red-edge using continuous narrow-band spectra from 626 nm to 795 nm.},

A high correlation was found between chlorophyll content and the wavelength of the red edge peak (lambda(re)), and between LAI (leaf area index) and the amplitude of the red edge peak (dr(re)), but the area of the red edge peak (SIGMAdr680-780 nm) was the best estimator of LAI. Thus, red edge was found valuable for assessment of plant chlorophyll concentration and LAI, and therefore nutritional status. Water stress also affected dr(re), but only when the stress was well developed.},

  Abstract                 = {The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) is used as an indicator of leaf and plant canopy photosynthetic efficiency. However, the photosynthetic efficiencyâ€“PRI relationship has been shown to be inconsistent over time, likely due to changes in foliar pigment content. We measured reflectance spectra and biochemical properties from 24 leaves of two deciduous tree species and acquired pigment and reflectance data from the Leaf Optical Properties EXperiment database for an additional nine species. These data were used as inputs for the PROSPECT-5 leaf optical model. We found measurements of PRI to be significantly (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05) correlated with chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, and the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio. However, only the PRIâ€“carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio relationship was consistent across all analyses. Two predictive equations were derived from PROSPECT-5 simulations: a curvilinear PRI model (PRI(clm)) predicted the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio (r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.99), and a linear model using the chlorophyll index (CI(lm)) predicted chlorophyll content (r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.98). Multiplying PRI(clm) with CI(lm) canceled the influence of chlorophyll content on PRI(clm) and thus allowed for prediction of carotenoid content from 11 deciduous tree species (r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.83). Our results confirm that the PRI is significantly influenced by chlorophyll and carotenoid pools and demonstrate a new approach for non-destructive estimation of leaf carotenoid content using the PRI. Because variation in foliar physiological status is known to relate to leaf carotenoid content and the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio, convolving the PRI with a chlorophyll index is likely to be useful for understanding the photosynthetic performance of deciduous vegetation across a wide range of temporal periods, ranging from daily to seasonal time scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of optical indices from hyperspectral remote sensing in the assessment of vegetation biophysical variables both in forestry and agriculture. Those indices are, however, the combined response to variations of several vegetation and environmental properties, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, canopy shadows, and background soil reflectance. Of particular significance to precision agriculture is chlorophyll content, an indicator of photosynthesis activity, which is related to the nitrogen concentration in green vegetation and serves as a measure of the crop response to nitrogen application. This paper presents a combined modeling and indices-based approach to predicting the crop chlorophyll content from remote sensing data while minimizing LAI (vegetation parameter) influence and underlying soil (background) effects. This combined method has been developed first using simulated data and followed by evaluation in terms of quantitative predictive capability using real hyperspectral airborne data. Simulations consisted of leaf and canopy reflectance modeling with PROSPECT and SAILH radiative transfer models. In this modeling study, we developed an index that integrates advantages of indices minimizing soil background effects and indices that are sensitive to chlorophyll concentration. Simulated data have shown that the proposed index Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) is both very sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and very resistant to the variations of LAI and solar zenith angle. It was therefore possible to generate a predictive equation to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from the combined optical index derived from above-canopy reflectance. This relationship was evaluated by application to hyperspectral CASI imagery collected over corn crops in three experimental farms from Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The results presented here are from the L'Acadie, Quebec, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada research site. Images of predicted leaf chlorophyll content were generated. Evaluation showed chlorophyll variability over crop plots with various levels of nitrogen, and revealed an excellent agreement with ground truth, with a correlation of r(2)=.81 between estimated and field measured chlorophyll content data.

  Abstract                 = {The retrieval of indicators of vegetation stress from remote sensing imagery is an important issue for the accurate assessment of forest decline. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has been demonstrated as a physiological index sensitive to the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and to photosynthetic efficiency, serving as a proxy for short-term changes in photosynthetic activity, stress condition, and pigment absorption, but highly affected by illumination conditions, viewing geometry and canopy structure. In this study, a diurnal airborne campaign was conducted over Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra forest areas with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) to evaluate the effects of canopy structure on PRI when used as an indicator of stress in a conifer forest. The AHS airborne sensor was flown at two times (8:00&#xa0;GMT and 12:00&#xa0;GMT) over forest areas under varying field-measured stress levels, acquiring 2&#xa0;m spatial resolution imagery in 80 spectral bands in the 0.43â€“12.5&#xa0;Î¼m spectral range. Five formulations of PRI (based on R531 as a xanthophyll-sensitive spectral band) were calculated using different reference wavelengths, such as PRI570 (reference band RREF&#xa0;=&#xa0;R570), and the PRI modifications PRIm1 (RREF&#xa0;=&#xa0;R512), PRIm2 (RREF&#xa0;=&#xa0;R600), PRIm3 (RREF&#xa0;=&#xa0;R670), and PRIm4 (RREF&#xa0;=&#xa0;R570, R670), along with other structural indices such as NDVI, SR, OSAVI, MSAVI and MTVI2. In addition, thermal bands were used for the retrieval of the land surface temperature. A radiative transfer modeling method was conducted using the LIBERTY and INFORM models to assess the structural effects on the PRI formulations proposed, studying the sensitivity of PRIm indices to detect stress levels while minimizing the effects caused by the conifer architecture. The PRI indices were related to stomatal conductance, xanthophyll epoxidation state (EPS) and crown temperature. The modeling analysis showed that the coefficient of variation (CV) for PRI was 50%, whereas the CV for PRIm1 (band R512 as a reference) was only 20%. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated that PRIm1 (RREF&#xa0;=&#xa0;R512) was less sensitive than PRI (RREF&#xa0;=&#xa0;R570) to changes in Leaf Area Index (LAI) and tree densities. PRI512 was demonstrated to be sensitive to EPS at both leaf (r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.59) and canopy level (r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.40), yielding superior performance than PRI570 (r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.21) at the canopy level. In addition, PRI512 was significantly related to water stress indicators such as stomatal conductance (Gs; r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.45) and water potential (Î¨; r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.48), yielding better results than PRI570 (Gs, r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.21; Î¨, r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.21) due to the structural effects found on the PRI570 index at the canopy level.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study explored the use of narrow-band indices formulated in the visible spectral region at leaf and canopy levels to estimate carotenoid content. The research area was a pine forest affected by decline processes. Spectral reflectance and pigment content including chlorophylls a and b (Ca&#xa0;+&#xa0;b), carotenoid (Cx&#xa0;+&#xa0;c) and xanthophyll cycle pigments (VAZ) were measured in needles for two consecutive years. The study was conducted using radiative transfer modeling methods and high-resolution airborne imagery acquired at 10&#xa0;nm FWHM bandwidth. Airborne data consisted of high spatial resolution imagery acquired with a narrow-band multispectral camera on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The imagery had 50&#xa0;cm resolution and six spectral bands in the 500â€“800&#xa0;nm range, enabling the identification of pure crowns to obtain the reflectance of individual trees. The indices evaluated were traditional formulations and new simple ratios developed by combining bands sensitive to Cx&#xa0;+&#xa0;c absorption in the 500â€“600&#xa0;nm region. The PROSPECT-5 model was coupled with the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to explore the performance of Cx&#xa0;+&#xa0;c-sensitive vegetation indices at leaf and canopy levels. The sensitivity of these indices to structural effects was assessed to study the potential scaling-up of Cx&#xa0;+&#xa0;c-related vegetation indices on heterogeneous canopies. Coefficients of determination between Cx&#xa0;+&#xa0;c content and narrow-band vegetation indices revealed that traditional indices were highly related with Cx&#xa0;+&#xa0;c content at leaf level (r2&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.90; P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001 for the CRI index (1/R515)â€“(1/R550)) but highly affected by structural parameters at crown level (r2&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.44; P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). A new simple-ratio vegetation index proposed in this study (R515/R570) was found to be significantly related with Cx&#xa0;+&#xa0;c content both at leaf (r2&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.72; P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and canopy levels (r2&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.71; P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Remote sensing cameras on board UAV platforms can provide very high multispectral and hyperspectral imagery for mapping biochemical constituents in heterogeneous forest canopies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of mapping carotenoid content to assess the physiological condition of forests.},

  Abstract                 = {Leaf chlorophyll content is an important variable for agricultural remote sensing because of its close relationship to leaf nitrogen content. The triangular greenness index (TGI) was developed based on the area of a triangle surrounding the spectral features of chlorophyll with points at (670 nm, R-670), (550 nm, R-550), and (480 nm, R-480), where R-lambda is the spectral reflectance at wavelengths of 670, 550 and 480, respectively. The equation is TGI = -0.5[(670 - 480)(R-570 - R-550) (670 - 550)(R-670 - R-480)]. In 1999, investigators funded by NASA's Earth Observations Commercialization and Applications Program collaborated on a nitrogen fertilization experiment with irrigated maize in Nebraska. Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data were acquired along with leaf chlorophyll meter and other data on three dates in July during late vegetative growth and early reproductive growth. TGI was consistently correlated with plot-averaged chlorophyll-meter values at the spectral resolutions of AVIRIS, Landsat TM, and digital cameras. Simulations using the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) canopy model indicate an interaction among TGI, leaf area index (LAI) and soil type at low crop LAI, whereas at high LAI and canopy closure, TGI was only affected by leaf chlorophyll content. Therefore, TGI may be the best spectral index to detect crop nitrogen requirements with low-cost digital cameras mounted on low-altitude airborne platforms. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Scattering is described by a spectral refractive index (n) and a parameter characterizing the leaf mesophyll structure (N). Absorption is modeled using pigment concentration (C(a+b)), water content (C(w)), and the corresponding specific spectral absorption coefficients (K(a+b) and K(w)). The parameters n, K(a+b), and K(w) have been fitted using experimental data corresponding to a wide range of plant types and status. PROSPECT has been tested successfully on independent data sets. It inversion allows one to reconstruct, with reasonable accuracy, leaf reflectance, and transmittance features in the 400-2500 nm range by adjusting the three input variables N, C(a+b), and C(w).},

It streamlines analysis of these data by allotving scientists to rapidly interact with entire datasets. SIPS provides visualization toolsfor rapid exploratory analysis and numerical tools for quantitative modeling. The user interface is X-Windows-based, user friendly, and provides ''point and click'' operation. SIPS is being used for multidisciplinary research concentrating on use of physically based analysis methods to enhance scientific resultsfrom imaging spectrometer data. The objective of this continuing effort is to develop operational techniques for quantitative analysis of imaging spectrometer data and to make them available to the scientific community prior to the launch of imaging spectrometer satellite systems such as the Earth Observing System (EOS) High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (HIRIS).},

  Abstract                 = {The UV-laser (lambda 355 nm) induced fluorescence emission spectra of green leaves comprise the blue (F440) and green (F520) fluorescence bands as well as the red (F690) and far-red (F740) chlorophyll fluorescence emission bands. Based on the four UV-laser induced fluorescence bands blue, green, red and far-red a high resolution fluorescence imaging system was established, which allows a fast and large scale screening of fluorescence gradients and local disturbances in fluorescence emission over the whole leaf surface. The new imaging method not only permits to screen leaves by means of images in four fluorescence bands (LIF images) but, in addition, via images of the fluorescence ratios blue/red (F440/F690), blue/far-red (F440/F740), the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio red/far-red (F690/F740) and the ratio blue/green (F440/F520) (LIF ratio images). By fluorescence imaging we could prove that in aurea tobacco the major part of the leaves' blue and green fluorescence is emitted from the main and side leave veins, whereas the major part of the leaves' red and far-red chlorophyll fluorescence is emitted from the vein-free leaf regions, which also have the highest chlorophyll content. A smaller proportion of the aurea tobacco leaves' blue-green fluorescence emission is derived from the cell walls of epidermis cells. The fluorescence ratios blue/red and blue/far-red are very sensitive to environmental changes, and thus permit early stress and strain detection in plants, and the evaluation of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Via monitoring the increase in chlorophyll fluorescence LIF images allow to detect differences in the time-dependent uptake of diuron and the progressing inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport in the treated leaf part. The novel fluorescence imaging technique sets a new dimension for early stress detection in the photosynthetic apparatus and in plants. It has many advantages over the previously applied point-data measurements of selected leaf points using conventional spectrofluorometers. The new fluorescence imaging system proved to be very suitable for remote sensing of plants in the near distance, and can be further developed for far distance remote sensing of the state of health of terrestrial vegetation. Some examples in the many possible ways of computer-aided fluorescence data processing (formation of different fluorescence ratios, screening of fluorescence profiles, histogramme plotting) are indicated.},

  Abstract                 = {<P>Fifty-three leaves were randomly sampled on different deciduous tree species, representing a wide range of chlorophyll contents, tree ages, and leaf structural features. Their reflectance was measured between 400 and 800 nm with a 1-nm step, and their chlorophyll content determined by extraction. A larger simulated database (11,583 spectra) was built using the PROSPECT model, in order to test, calibrate, and obtain universal indices, i.e., indices applicable to a wide range of species and leaf structure. To our knowledge, almost all leaf chlorophyll indices published in the literature since 1973 have been tested on both databases. Fourteen canonical types of indices (published ones and new ones) were identified, and their wavelengths calibrated on the simulated database as well as on the experimental database to determine the best wavelengths and, hence, the best performances in chlorophyll estimation for each index types. These indices go from simple reflectance ratios to more sophisticated indices using reflectance first derivatives (using the Savitzky and Golay method). We also tested other nondestructive methods to obtain total chlorophyll concentration: SPAD (Minolta Camera, Osaka, Japan) and neural networks. The validity of the actual PROSPECT model is challenged by our results: Important discordances are found when the indices are calculated with PROSPECT compared to experimental data, especially for some indices and wavelengths. The discordance is even greater when the indices are determined with PROSPECT and applied on the experimental database. A new calibration of PROSPECT is therefore necessary for any study aiming at using simulated spectra to determine or to calibrate indices. The ''peak jump'' and the multiple-peak feature observed on the first derivative of the reflectances (e.g., in the Red-Edge Inflection Point [REIP] index) has been investigated. It was shown that chlorophyll absorption alone can explain this feature. The peak jump disqualifies the REIP to be a valuable chlorophyll index. A simple modified difference ratio gave the best results among all published indices (cross-validated RMSE=2.1 <IMG SRC=#/iso-ents/isogrk32/mu-s.gif# ALT=#mu#>g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> on the experimental database). After calibration on the experimental database, modified Simple Ratio (mSR) and modified Normalized Difference (mND) indices gave the best performances (RMSECV=1.8 <IMG SRC=#/iso-ents/isogrk32/mu-s.gif# ALT=#mu#>g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> on the experimental database). The new Double Difference (DD) index, although not the best on the experimental database (RMSECV=2.9 <IMG SRC=#/iso-ents/isogrk32/mu-s.gif# ALT=#mu#>g/cm<SUP>2</SUP>), has the best results on the larger simulated database (RMSE=3.7 <IMG SRC=#/iso-ents/isogrk32/mu-s.gif# ALT=#mu#>g/cm<SUP>2</SUP>) and is expected to give good results on larger experimental databases. The best reflectance-based indices give better performances than the current commercial nondestructive device SPAD (RMSECV=4.5 <IMG SRC=#/iso-ents/isogrk32/mu-s.gif# ALT=#mu#>g/cm<SUP>2</SUP>). In this leaf-level study, the best indices are very near from each other, so that complex methods are useless: REIP-like, neural networks, and derivative-based indices are not necessary and give worst results than simpler properly chosen indices. These conclusions will certainly be different for a canopy-level study, where the derivative-based indices may perform significantly better than the other ones.</P>},

Reflectance is a passive sensing technique that can capture differences in the concentration of the primary plant pigments. Fluorescence and reflectance were compared for their ability to measure levels of plant stress that are of agronomic importance in corn (Zea mays L.) crops. Laboratory LIF and reflectance spectra were made on excised leaves from field grown corn. Changes in the visible region of the spectrum were compared between groups of plants fertilized with seven different levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization. A pulsed nitrogen laser emitting photons at a wavelength of 337 nm was used as a fluorescence excitation source. Differences in maximum intensity of fluorescence occurred at 440 nm, 525 nm, 685 nm, and 740 nm. Significant separations were found between levels of N fertilization at several LIF wavelength ratios. Several reflectance algorithms also produced significant separations between certain levels of N fertilization.},

An increase of reflectance between 550 and 740 nm accompanied senescence-induced degradation of chlorophyll (Chl), whereas in the range 400â€“500 nm it remained low, due to retention of carotenoids (Car). It was found that both leaf senescence and fruit ripening affect the difference between reflectance (R) near 670 and 500 nm (R678âˆ’R500), depending on pigment composition. The plant senescing reflectance index in the form (R678âˆ’R500)/R750 was found to be sensitive to the Car/Chl ratio, and was used as a quantitative measure of leaf senescence and fruit ripening. The changes in the index were followed during leaf senescence, and natural and ethylene-induced fruit ripening. This novel index can be used for estimating the onset, the stage, relative rates and kinetics of senescence/ripening processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Remote sensing of grass quantity is important for providing information about the productivity and functioning of rangelands. Existing indices used to estimate grass quantity, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are of limited value due to the saturation problem, especially in dense vegetation with 100% leaf area cover. Therefore, there is need to explore new techniques to resolve the saturation problem. In this study we tested the utility of band depth analysis to estimate grass quantity in dense vegetation. Band depth indices calculated from continuum-removed spectra of Cenchrus ciliaris grass, measured at canopy level in the visible spectral domain (550-750 nm) were used to estimate biomass. Band depth analysis results were compared to two narrow band NDVIs calculated using near-infrared and red bands. Results indicate that, the band depth analysis methodology could estimate quantity with a high coefficient of determination of 0.81, 0.83, 0.86 and 0.85 for band depth (BD), band depth ratio (BDR), normalized band depth index (NBDI) and band depth normalized to area (BNA), respectively. Narrow band NDVIs yielded lower correlations (0.31 and 0.32 for NDVI 1 and NDVI 2, respectively). Thus, band depth can estimate quantity in densely vegetated areas where NDVI values reach an asymptote.},

  Abstract                 = {Remotely sensed vegetation indices such as NDVI, computed using the red and near infrared bands have been used to estimate pasture biomass. These indices are of limited value since they saturate in dense vegetation. In this study, we evaluated the potential of narrow band vegetation indices for characterizing the biomass of Cenchrus ciliaris grass measured at high canopy density. Three indices were tested: Modified Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MNDVI), Simple Ratio (SR) and Transformed Vegetation Index (TVI) involving all possible two band combinations between 350 nm and 2500 nm. In addition, we evaluated the potential of the red edge position in estimating biomass at full canopy cover. Results indicated that the standard NDVI involving a strong chlorophyll absorption band in the red region and a near infrared band performed poorly in estimating biomass ( R(2) = 0.26). The MNDVIs involving a combination of narrow bands in the shorter wavelengths of the red edge ( 700 - 750 nm) and longer wavelengths of the red edge ( 750 - 780 nm), yielded higher correlations with biomass ( mean R(2) = 0.77 for the highest 20 narrow band NDVIs). When the three vegetation indices were compared, SR yielded the highest correlation coefficients with biomass as compared to narrow band NDVI and TVI ( average R(2) = 0.80, 0.77 and 0.77 for the first 20 ranked SR, NDVI and TVI respectively). The red edge position yielded comparable results to the narrow band vegetation indices involving the red edge bands. These results indicate that at high canopy density, pasture biomass may be more accurately estimated by vegetation indices based on wavelengths located in the red edge than the standard NDVI.},

  Abstract                 = {The ratio between carotenoid and chlorophyll a concentrations (Car/Chla) is indicative of the physiology and phenology of plants. With the aim of assessing this Car/Chla pigment ratio from reflectance (R), a wide range of leaves from several species and conditions were measured with high spectral resolution spectroradiometers for lambda between 400 and 800 nn. The performances of three pigment reflectance indices: (1) simple ratio pigment index (SRPI = R(lambda 1)/R(lambda 2)), (2) normalized difference pigment index [NDPI = (R(lambda 1) - R(lambda 2))/(R(lambda 1) + R(lambda 2))], and (3) the structure insensitive pigment index [SIPI = (R(800) - R(lambda 1))/(R(800) - R(lambda 2))] were tested. For each pigment index, every set of wavebands [lambda(1), lambda(2)] was systematically tested. High correlations with Car/Chla were found for all these pigment indices in the blue-red domain [400 nm<lambda 1<530 nm, 600 nm<lambda(2)<700 nm] as expected since both Chl and Car absorb in the blue; while only Chl absorbs in the red.

  Abstract                 = {We followed diurnal and seasonal changes in physiology and spectral reflectance of leaves throughout the canopies of sunflower plants grown in control, nitrogen (N)-limited, and water-stressed plots. Leaves from control sunflower plants had significantly higher levels of nitrogen, chlorophyll (chl), ribulose bis phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPCase) activity and photosynthetic rates and lower starch content and leaf thickness than N-limited plants. Water-stressed plants had the highest N and chl contents (on an area basis). They also had the lowest water potential and photosynthetic rates, in spite of maintaining high RuBPCase activities. Leaves from stressed plants (especially N-limited) had significantly higher reflectances in the visible wavelengths and lower in the near IR than leaves from control plants. The only clear trend across canopy levels was the higher reflectance at all wavelengths but especially in the visible of the lower (oldest) leaves. NDVI-like parameters were useful in distinguishing stress and control leaves over the growing season. However, several narrow-band indices provided better physiological information than NDVI. The physiological reflectance index (PRI) (R550 - R530/R550 + R530) followed diurnal changes in xanthophyll pigments and photosynthetic rates Of control and N-limited leaves. The maximum of the first derivative of reflectance in the green (dG) was correlated with diurnal photosynthetic rate, and with seasonal chl and N changes. The normalized pigment chlorophyll ratio Index (NPCI) (R680 - R430/R680 + R430) varied with total pigments/chl. The water band index (WBI) (R970/R902) followed water status. The normalized ratio between the maxima of the first derivatives of reflectances at the red edge and green regions (EGFN) was correlated with chl and N content. Principal components analysis yielded several indicators of physiological status. The first principal component was higher in control leaves, the second was higher in N-limited leaves, and the third was higher in water-limited leaves. Discriminant analysis based on the combination of several narrow-band spectral indices clearly separated leaves into the three treatment groups. These results illustrate the promise of narrow-band spectroradiometry for assessing the physiological state of vegetation.},

Reflectance and PWC were measured for adult plants growing in the field throughout an annual cycle and in potted seedlings submitted to progressive desiccation. The species studied were characteristicly Mediterranean: Pinus halepensis, Quercus ilex, Quercus coccifera, Arbutus unedo, Cistus albidus, Cistus monspeliensis, Phillyrea angustifolia, Pistacia lentiscus and Brachypodium retusum . WI was significantly correlated with PWC when all the species were considered together, and with almost all the species considered individually, especially when a wider range of PWC was obtained by extreme dessication of experimental plants. The correlations increased when normalizing WI by NDVI. The wavelength of the trough corresponding to water absorption band tended to shift from 970-980 nm to lower wavelengths 930-950 nm with decreasing PWCs. Infrared measurement of plant temperature and T leaf - T air provided worse assessment of PWC. A simple radiometer measuring plant reflectance at 680, 900, and 970nm could speed up the measurement of PWC, and be useful in wildfire risk evaluation and drought assessment. },

These indices are theoretically more reliable than NDVI, although they are not yet widely used with satellite data. This article focuses on testing and comparing the sensitivity of NDVI, SAVI, TSAVI, MSAVI and GEMI to soil background effects. Indices are simulated with the SAIL model for a large range of soil reflectances, including sand, clay, and dark peat, with additional variations induced by moisture and roughness. The general formulation of the SAVI family of indices with the form VI = (NIR - R)/(NIR + R + X) is also reexamined. The value of the parameter X is critical in the minimization of soil effects. A value of X = 0.16 is found as the optimized value. Index performances are compared by means of an analysis of variance.},

Current estimates are based on retrieving the fraction (f(APAR)) of PAR absorbed by the canopy from spectral vegetation indices (SVI) derived from combinations of spectral reflectance measurements. We show that currently used SVI are strongly affected by the soil reflectance as well as the sun/view geometry, which yields large uncertainties on the SVI-f(APAR) statistical relationships. However, the errors can be reduced using optimal geometries and new SVI less affected by the soil reflectance. Such an approach yields an improvement of the f(APAR) assessment down to less than 5% of relative standard error. It is relevant for monitoring of the interannual variations of the net primary productivity (NPP) and its analysis to understand the climate sensitivity of the present ecosystems. These will perm it more detailed studies of seasonal and regional biospheric carbon sources and sinks that affect the global distribution of atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

  Abstract                 = {<P>Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can be applied across species with varying leaf structural characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content. We also found that an index based on the first derivative of reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes) was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves. This result has important implications for the interpretation of PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in heterogeneous natural environments.</P>},

Yield/ha was based on estimates of the area harvested and actual grain received by the Cooperative Bulk Handling Ltd. The study area covered 16.3 million ha, in which 2.9 million ha of wheat were sown and 4.66 million tonnes of grain harvested. This was 78% of the total Western Australian wheat crop. Spatial variations in NDVI in early July, at around stem elongation, accounted for 46% of the spatial variation in final yield. This increased to 56% of yield variance around the onset of anthesis at the end of August. It remained high until early November (48%) when crops were senescing or senescent. A combination of NDVI from late August and early November accounted for 70% of the yield variance. In comparison, total rainfall during the 1992 growing season from April to October, the main determinant of yield variations, accounted for 28% of the yield variation. The significant correlation of NDVI with final yield by the middle of the growing season 3 to 5 months before harvest indicates the feasibility of making useful yield forecasts from this time onwards. In addition, the NDVI could provide useful spatial information on the significance of the yield/canopy development/water use relationship which underlies this correlation.},

Some important theoretical and technical issues involved in physical inversion problems were addressed. Based on the field reference spectra of image components, a constrained least-squares method was applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper data over an area in Long Valley, Nevada to calculate vegetation abundance in a pixel. A method for formulating a well-conditioned spectral mixture by calculating the cosine of the angles between the candidate surface components was presented. This method provides a way to measure the separability of candidate endmembers quantitatively and derive spectral endmembers objectively. The results of this study suggest that the ambiguity or uncertainty in physical inversion problems arises from the inability to provide a complete set of representative reference spectra and to formulate a well-conditioned spectral mixture, not from the least-squares method itself. Some of import implications of the study include the following: (1) the unmixing techniques can provide moderate estimates of vegetation fractions in arid rangeland, where vegetation is sparse, with TM data; and (2) the degree of spectral pureness of endmembers should be consistent between endmember spectra that are used for unmixing.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this paper is to determine spectral bands that are best suited for characterizing agricultural crop biophysical variables. The data for this study comes from ground-level hyperspectral reflectance measurements of cotton, potato, soybeans, corn, and sunflower. Reflectance was measured in 490 discrete narrow bands between 350 and 1,050 nm. Observed crop characteristics included wet biomass, leaf area index, plant height, and (for cotton only) yield. Three types of hyperspectral predictors were tested: optimum multiple narrow band reflectance (OMNBR), narrow band normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) involving all possible two-band combinations of 490 channels, and the soil-adjusted vegetation indices. A critical problem with OMNBR models was that of â€œover fittingâ€ (i.e., using more spectral channels than experimental samples to obtain a highly maximum R2 value). This problem was addressed by comparing the R2 values of crop variables with the R2 values computed for random data of a large sample size. The combinations of two to four narrow bands in OMNBR models explained most (64% to 92%) of the variability in crop biophysical variables. The second part of the paper describes a rigorous search procedure to identify the best narrow band NDVI predictors of crop biophysical variables. Special narrow band lambda (Î»1) versus lambda (Î»2) plots of R2 values illustrate the most effective wavelength combinations (Î»1 and Î»2) and bandwidths (Î”Î»1 and Î”Î»2) for predicting the biophysical quantities of each crop. The best of these two-band indices were further tested to see if soil adjustment or nonlinear fitting could improve their predictive accuracy. The best of the narrow band NDVI models explained 64% to 88% variability in different crop biophysical variables. A strong relationship with crop characteristics is located in specific narrow bands in the longer wavelength portion of the red (650 nm to 700 nm), with secondary clusters in the shorter wavelength portion of green (500 nm to 550 nm), in one particular section of the near-infrared (900 nm to 940 nm), and in the moisture sensitive near-infrared (centered at 982 nm). This study recommends a 12 narrow band sensor, in the 350 nm to 1,050 nm range of the spectrum, for optimum estimation of agricultural crop biophysical information.},

  Abstract                 = {With the goal of applying derivative spectral analysis to analyze high-resolution, spectrally continuous remote sensing data, several smoothing and derivative computation algorithms have been reviewed and modified to develop a set of cross-platform spectral analysis tools. Emphasis was placed on exploring different smoothing and derivative algorithms to extract spectral details from spectral data sets. A modular program was created to perform interactive derivative analysis. This module calculated derivatives using either a convolution (Savitzky-Golay) or finite divided difference approximation algorithm. Spectra were smoothed using one of the three built-in smoothing algorithms (Savitzky-Golay smoothing, Kawata-Minami smoothing, and mean-filter smoothing) prior to the derivative computation procedures. Laboratory spectral data were used to test the performance of the implemented derivative analysis module. An algorithm for detecting the absorption band positions was executed on synthetic spectra and a soybean fluorescence spectrum to demonstrate the usage of the implemented modules in extracting spectral features. Issues related to smoothing and spectral deviation caused by the smoothing and spectral deviation caused by the smoothing or derivative computation algorithms were also observed and are discussed. A scaling effect, resulting from the migration of band separations when using the finite divided difference approximation derivative algorithm, can be used to enhance spectral features at the scale of specified sampling interval and remove noise or features smaller than the sampling interval.

  Abstract                 = {Many sugar maple stands in the northeastern United States experienced extensive insect damage during the 1988 growing season. Chlorophyll data and high spectral resolution spectrometer laboratory reflectance data were acquired for multiple collections of single detached sugar maple leaves variously affected by the insect over the 1988 growing season. Reflectance data indicated consistent and diagnostic differences in the red edge portion (680-750 nm) of the spectrum among the various samples and populations of leaves. These included differences in the red edge inflection point (REIP), a ratio of reflectance at 740-720 nm (RE3/RE2), and a ratio of first derivative values at 715-705 nm (D715/D705). All three red edge parameters were highly correlated with variation in total chlorophyll content. Other spectral measures, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Simple Vegetation Index Ratio (VI), also varied among populations and over the growing season, but did not correlate well with total chlorophyll content. Leaf stacking studies on light and dark backgrounds indicated REIP, RE3/RE2 and D715/D705 to be much less influenced by differences in green leaf biomass and background condition than either NDVI or VI.},

  Abstract                 = {Scientific and technical challenges remain significant to accurate classification of land cover and forest species as a result of the many spectral and spatial variables influencing surface reflectance, coupled with the constraints imposed by the spectral and spatial characteristics of the remote sensing instrumentation. The use of systematic differences in canopy pigment or chemistry by cover type or by species as a basis for land cover classification has very recently emerged as a potentially new approach. In this study, classification of land cover is investigated, based on chlorophyll content variations as inferred from spectral bands in the red edge reflectance region. This analysis was carried out on data collected with the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) for a 16 km x 12 km image mosaic over the submodeling grid of the southern study area at the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). The analysis demonstrates that land cover mapping, based solely on red edge spectral parameters, appears to be feasible, robust, and for some cover classes outperforms other current classification methods. Classification accuracy assessments of the derived land cover maps were performed using a forest inventory map provided by the Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management Forestry Branch-Inventory Unit (SERM-FBIU). The red edge parameter-based land cover classification showed producer's accuracies which exceeded 68.6% for all classes identified: conifers (however, without an ability to separate wet from dry conifers), mixed stands, fen, and disturbed and regeneration features. The corresponding user's accuracies for these classes ranged between 58 and 66%, with the overall classification accuracies of 61.15% and Kappa coefficient (K) of 0.52. In comparison, the corresponding Kappa coefficients for the cover classification using 16 channel CASI data and for a TM-based classification, were 0.36 and 0.29, respectively. Results of this study suggest that whereas land cover classification accuracy improvements for the important but illusive fen cover type in the boreal ecosystem are possible using classifications based on red edge parameters, significant uncertainties remain in the estimated aerial extent.},

  Abstract                 = {<P>A series of experiments carried out in a controlled environment facility to induce steady-state chlorophyll a fluorescence variation demonstrate that natural fluorescence emission is observable on the derivative reflectance spectra as a double-peak feature in the 690-710 nm spectral region. This work describes that the unexplained double-peak feature previously seen on canopy derivative reflectance is due entirely to chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) effects, demonstrating the importance of derivative methods for fluorescence detection in vegetation. Measurements were made in a controlled environmental chamber where temperature and humidity were varied through the time course of the experiments in both short- and long-term trials using Acer negundo ssp. californium canopies. Continuous canopy reflectance measurements were made with a spectrometer on healthy and stressed vegetation, along with leaf-level steady-state fluorescence measurements with the PAM-2000 Fluorometer during both temperature-stress induction and recovery stages. In 9-h trials, temperatures were ramped from 10 to 35 <SUP>o</SUP>C and relative humidity adjusted from 92% to 42% during stress induction, returning gradually to initial conditions during the recovery stage. Canopy reflectance difference calculations and derivative analysis of reflectance spectra demonstrate that a double-peak feature created between 688, 697 and 710 nm on the derivative reflectance is a function of natural steady-state fluorescence emission, which gradually diminished with induction of maximum stress. Derivative reflectance indices based on this double-peak feature are demonstrated to track natural steady-state fluorescence emission as quantified by two indices, the double-peak index (DPi) and the area of the double peak (A<SUB>dp</SUB>). Results obtained employing these double-peak indices from canopy derivative reflectance suggest a potential for natural steady-state fluorescence detection with hyperspectral data. Short- and long-term stress effects on the observed double-peak derivative indices due to pigment degradation and canopy structure changes were studied, showing that both indices are capable of tracking steady-state fluorescence changes from canopy remote sensing reflectance.</P>},
